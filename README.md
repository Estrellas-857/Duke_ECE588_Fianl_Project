## Abstract

License Plate Recognition (LPR) plays a pivotal role in applications ranging from traffic mon-
itoring to law enforcement and automated toll collection. This study conducts a comparative
analysis of LPR, contrasting traditional image processing techniques with advanced deep learning
approaches. Starting with conventional Tesseract optical character recognition (OCR) methods,
the research covers image pre-processing, segmentation, character recognition, and template match-
ing, emphasizing their interpretability and control. The exploration then extends to modern OCR
methods, including Tesseract OCR’s Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based forms, highlighting
LSTM’s improved handling of complex text layouts. Subsequently, a Convolutional Neural Net-
works (CNN) based model and an End-to-End CNN model for LPR are developed. Intriguingly,
these models, while proficient in feature extraction and pattern recognition, does not surpass tra-
ditional methods in speed and accuracy in our tests. This outcome underlines the complexities
of applying deep learning to specific real-world scenarios. The comparative study evaluates these
approaches, revealing that while deep learning approaches offer robustness and adaptability, tradi-
tional methods maintain relevance through their precision and interpretability in certain contexts.
This research aims to inform the development of LPR systems, balancing traditional and deep
learning techniques to meet the diverse needs of intelligent transportation systems.
