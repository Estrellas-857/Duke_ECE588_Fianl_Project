A traditional approach to license plate recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), combined with classic computer vision techniques for preprocessing.

1. Preprocessing and Character Segmentation:

The script starts by using OpenCV to preprocess the image and extract the license plate, presumably using the extract_license_plate function (similar to the one you previously shared).
It then segments the alphanumeric characters from the license plate using contour detection. The find_contours function converts the image to grayscale, applies thresholding, and then uses cv2.findContours to detect contours.
Each detected character is resized, formatted, and stored in a list for further processing.

2. CNN Model for Character Recognition:

The script creates a CNN using Keras, designed for classifying segmented characters.
The model consists of convolutional layers (Conv2D), max pooling (MaxPooling2D), dropout layers (Dropout) for regularization, and dense layers (Dense) for final classification.
The network is trained to classify 36 classes (digits and uppercase letters), which is suitable for reading standard license plates.

3. Data Augmentation and Training:

Data augmentation is employed using ImageDataGenerator, which helps improve the model's robustness by introducing variations (like shifts and rescales) in the training data.
The script sets up training and validation generators, pointing to directories where training and validation images are stored.

4. Model Training and Callbacks:

The model is compiled and trained using the fit_generator method, with callbacks for early stopping (stop_training_callback) and logging (tensorboard_callback).
The training process continues until the validation accuracy surpasses a certain threshold or the maximum number of epochs is reached.

5. Character Recognition and Aggregation:

The show_results function takes the segmented character images, preprocesses them to fit the input shape of the CNN, and then uses the trained model to predict the characters.
Predictions for each character are aggregated to form the complete license plate number.

This approach combines classic computer vision methods for segmentation with deep learning for character recognition. It's an effective way to handle the complex task of license plate recognition, leveraging the strengths of both traditional image processing and modern neural networks.
